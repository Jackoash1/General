To begin, open up the html webpage "dogs_life_homepage.html"

In the contact_us webpage, you can utilise the google maps provided, it is interactable.

With the Login/Signup page, they do not work as intended, however you can attempt to login or signup and see that it does connect to a php file.

There is also no database management webpage as it would be impossible to get to in the way that I planned, also the database management webpage would be useless without a working PHP database
